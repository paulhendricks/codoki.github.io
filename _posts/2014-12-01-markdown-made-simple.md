It seems like Markdown is everywhere these days.
Markdown is awesome, but can be a bit intimidating if you dont know where to start.
Here I've provided a simple guide to getting started with .md.
Each section is broken into the example code, followed by the result. Enjoy!

#1. Header/Title tags

Code:

```
# This is my H1
## And my H2
### And H3
#### And so on
```

# This is my H1
## And my H2
### And H3
#### And so on

-----

#2. Paragraph

Code:

```
Paragraphs are simply one or more consecutive lines!
Bacon ipsum dolor amet pork loin ribeye cupim tri-tip short loin, brisket beef meatloaf.
Kielbasa ham frankfurter spare ribs brisket.

Here is two paragraphs broken by a line.
Bacon ipsum dolor amet pork loin ribeye cupim tri-tip short loin, brisket beef meatloaf.

Kielbasa ham frankfurter spare ribs brisket.
```

Paragraphs are simply one or more consecutive lines!
Bacon ipsum dolor amet pork loin ribeye cupim tri-tip short loin, brisket beef meatloaf.
Kielbasa ham frankfurter spare ribs brisket.

Here is two paragraphs broken by a line.

#3. Styling Text

#5. Lists

Code:

*You can also use *, +, -, numbers(1. 2. 3. etc)*

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

* Item 1

* Item 3

#6. Code formating

Code:

```
``` Some Code here for code block ```
or `Code here` for inline code
```

{% highlight js %}
Some Code here for code block
// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
{% endhighlight %}

or `Code here` for inline code
