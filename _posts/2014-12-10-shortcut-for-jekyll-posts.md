Here is a quick tip for automatically generating a new Jekyll post in terminal with a quick bash function.

First, start out by creating a default Jekyll post and placing it in your `_posts` folder.
Call it `2014-01-01-post-template.md` and place this template code in as a starting point.
Feel free to change this as you see fit.

```
---
layout: post
title:
comments: true
tags: []
---
```

Next, add this to your `~/.bash_profile`

```
DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
newJekyllPost() {
	cp ~/Sites/yourusername.github.io/_posts/2014-01-01-post-template.md ~/Sites/yourusername.github.io/_posts/$DATE-$1.md
	vi ~/Sites/yourusername.github.io/_posts/$DATE-$1.md
}
alias newpost=newJekyllPost
alias editpost='vi ~/Sites/yourusername.github.io/_posts'
```

Then, save your .bash_profile and restart terminal.
This function copies your post template and renames it using the correct Jekyll naming convention.
Type `newpost your-new-post` and this little bash function will automatically generate
a new jekyll post with the right date and open VIM.
I also added a bash alias at the end that easily allows me to view my posts folder in VIM to choose which to edit.

No more manually adding posts (and trying to remember what day it is)!
